 that arenâ€™t tracked have a ?? next to them, new files that have
been added to the staging area have an A, modified files have an M and so on.
There are two columns to the output - the left-hand column indicates the status
of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the working
tree. So for example in that output, the README file is modified in the working
directory but not yet staged, while the lib/simplegit.rb file is modified
and staged. The Rakefile was modified, staged and then modified again, so
there are changes to it that are both staged and unstaged.
